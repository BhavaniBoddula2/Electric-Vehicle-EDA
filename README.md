Electric Vehicle Data Analysis:


ðŸš—âš¡ Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the adoption and distribution of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-world data. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover insights into EV trends, geographical distribution, and the evolution of different vehicle makes over time.

ðŸ“Š Tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Univariate analysis to understand the distribution of key features like EV make, year, and location.
- Bivariate analysis to discover relationships between variables such as EV counts across different locations and years.

  
Choropleth Map:

Visualize the number of EVs based on geographical location using a choropleth map created with Plotly.


Racing Bar Plot:

Animate the growth of EV makes over time with a dynamic Racing Bar Plot using Plotly.


ðŸ—‚ Dataset :

The dataset includes information on Electric Vehicles, their locations, makes, years of production, and additional relevant features. Below are some of the columns used in the analysis:

Year: The year the data was recorded or the vehicle was manufactured.

Make: The manufacturer of the electric vehicle.

Location: Geographical location where the EV data was recorded.

EV_count: Number of EV vehicles for each make, year, and location.

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations :

1. Choropleth Map
   
Displays the number of EVs by location to highlight geographical patterns of EV adoption.

2. Racing Bar Plot
 
An animated bar chart that showcases the popularity of EV manufacturers over time.

3. Bivariate Analysis Visualizations
 
Scatter Plot: Relationships between numerical variables like EV_count and Year.

Box Plot: Distributions of EV counts by manufacturer (make).

Correlation Heatmap: Understanding correlations between numerical variables in the dataset.
